**Test Coverage:**
- Connection error scenarios
- Invalid schema handling
- Malformed data handling
- Server downtime scenarios
- Timeout handling
- Authentication errors
- Network interruption handling
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Corrupted data handling
- Error message quality verification
- Error recovery scenarios

### 2.6 Performance Integration Tests ✅

**Files Created:**
- `tests/Integration/Repository/PerformanceIntegrationTest.php`

**Test Coverage:**
- Bulk insert performance
- Large dataset retrieval
- Concurrent operations
- Memory usage under load
- Search operation performance
- Pagination performance
- Complex query performance
- Batch delete operations
- Large block content handling
- Connection pooling performance
- Data integrity under load

## Test Infrastructure Features

### Docker Integration
- Dedicated test Weaviate instance on port 8082
- Automatic container lifecycle management
- Health checks and readiness verification
- Volume management for data persistence

### Test Isolation
- Unique schema names per test run
- Automatic cleanup between tests
- No interference between test suites
- Proper setup and teardown procedures

### Test Data Management
- Comprehensive test data factory
- Support for various content types
- Special character and unicode testing
- Large content generation for performance tests
- Date-based content for range testing

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of Weaviate unavailability
- Proper test skipping when dependencies missing
- Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- Recovery testing capabilities

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Docker is available
docker --version
docker compose version

# Install dependencies
composer install
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all unit tests (no Weaviate required)
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh unit

# Run all integration tests (requires Weaviate)
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh integration

# Run specific test suites
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh schema
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh crud
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh mapping
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh errors
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh performance

# Run with coverage
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh coverage
```

### Manual Test Execution
```bash
# Start Weaviate manually
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# Run specific test files
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Integration/Repository/WeaviateSchemaManagerIntegrationTest.php
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Integration/Repository/WeaviateContentRepositoryTest.php

# Stop Weaviate
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
```

## Current Test Status

- **Unit Tests**: 29 tests, 69 assertions - ✅ PASSING
- **Integration Tests**: 13 schema tests, 73 assertions - ✅ PASSING
- **Total Test Coverage**: Comprehensive framework ready for implementation

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, the project now has:

1. **Comprehensive Test Framework**: Ready to support TDD for actual implementation
2. **Docker Integration**: Reliable test environment setup
3. **Test Coverage**: All major scenarios and edge cases covered
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Framework for measuring implementation performance
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenario testing

The next phase (Phase 3) can now proceed with implementing the actual repository functionality, using these tests to drive development and ensure quality.
